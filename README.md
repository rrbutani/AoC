# AoC
Advent of Code Solutions (indescribable atrocities within)

#### This year:

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Elm
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] ??? I'm leaning towards Clojure.

Why 7? Blame [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).

I probably won't get through all 175 solutions, but I'm planning to at least write Rust solutions for all 25.

For Rust: add `rustr` (in common/) to your path, build the aoc crate (run `cargo build --release` in common/rust/aoc/), and then run as you would any binary (i.e. `./time_drift.rs`). Set `$offline` to run _without_ contacting AoC's servers.
