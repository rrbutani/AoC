# AoC
Advent of Code Solutions (indescribable atrocities within)

#### This year:

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Elm
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] ??? Common Lisp? Ruby? Swift? OCaml? Clojure? Pony? Crystal? Prolog? _Javascript?_ I'm leaning towards Clojure for now.

Why 7? Blame [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).

I probably won't get through all 175 solutions, but I'm planning to at least write Python and Rust solutions for all 25.
